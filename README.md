# Go Web

Description
-

- A collection of Go projects built by following YouTube tutorials, blog posts, and other community resources
- The main goal of this repo is to deepen understanding(where needed) or summarize my knowledge of writting idiomatic Go, with a strong focus on:
  - Networking (net/http, sync, goroutines)
  - Web services and RESTful APIs
  - Microservices architecture
  - gRPC and Protocol Buffers

Each project is hands-on and meant to reinforce best practices, common patterns, and practical experience with Go in a modern backend development context.
